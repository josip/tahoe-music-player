=== Running the tests ===
== Prerequsites ==
= Windmill=
In order to run the tests make sure you have the latest Windmill[1][2]
(as of July 30th 2010 it means you'll have to build it from the trunk because
it contains a crutial fix)

You can obtain the latest copy of Windmill by running the following commands
from your shell:
  $ cd ~/bin
  $ git pull git://github.com/windmill/windmill
  $ python setup.py build
  $ sudo python setup.py install

= Working browser =
You'll also need a working browser, the tests are intented to be ran in
Google Chrome (not Chromium) and/or Firefox.

By default Google Chrome will be used.

If you do not have Google Chrome installed on your computer, to use Firefox
you'll have to edit the src/allmydata/tests/test_musicplayer.py file.

== Building the project ==
Components needed by da.controller.Player and da.controller.CollectionScanner tests
are only available after we've built the from project. (Web workers and SoundManger's Flash files).

  $ cd <directory with this file>
  $ python manage.py build

== Running the tests ==
To run the music player-specific tests simply:

  $ cd <Tahoe-LAFS source directory>
  $ python setup.py test -s allmydata.test.test_musicplayer

If you have any Google Chrome winows open, remember to close them before
running the tests, otherwise Windmill won't be able to work its magick.

== Problematic tests ==
* test_ProgressBar, test_SegmentedProgressBar: these might or might not fail,
  the reason is that browsers don't render the graphics precisely the same.
  They will probably (partially) fail in Firefox.
* test_ID3v1: This test usually fails on Linux version of Google Chrome.
  Reasons are still unknown.
 
== Debugging tips ==
* Chrome is definitely faster, but Firefox gives better error messages.
  To view more detailed messages than those presented by Windmill type
  following into Web Inspector's or Firebugs' console:
  
  `windmill.jsTests.testFailures`

=== Documentation ===
Player's code is fully annotated with PDoc[2] syntax, which can then generate
lovely web site for easier navigation.

To generate the API documentation you'll need latest version of PDoc:

  $ sudo gem install pdoc

After you've installed PDoc just run:

  $ cd <directory with this file>
  $ python manage.py docs
  $ open-in-web-browser docs/index.html

Note: You will be probably greeted with few 'missing dependencies' errors
from PDoc, just install them manually and you're good to go.
